# Samsara: Decentralized Asset Treasury Research

## Abstract
This repository documents research and observations on Samsara, a platform by Nirvana that enables teams to launch decentralized Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) on Solana. The focus is on understanding treasury-backed assets, on-chain capital coordination, and mechanisms designed to support sustainability, ownership, and privacy by default within decentralized ecosystems.

## Context
As decentralized protocols increasingly experiment with treasury-backed models, DATs represent a new financial primitive that blends long-term capital management with on-chain transparency. Samsara offers a framework for teams to design, manage, and evolve these treasuries in a permissionless environment.

## Key Areas of Exploration
- Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) on Solana  
- Treasury-backed asset design  
- Floor mechanisms and downside protection  
- Capital coordination and incentive alignment  
- Privacy by default vs transparent on-chain systems  

## Methodology
This work is exploratory and research-oriented, based on:
- Public documentation and protocol materials  
- On-chain observations  
- Comparative analysis with existing treasury-backed models  

## Status
Ongoing research.  
This repository may expand with deeper analysis, diagrams, economic modeling, or experimental findings over time.
